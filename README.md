# Customer Purchase Prediction Using Decision Tree Classifier

This repository contains the code and results of building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is used for this project.

## Dataset Description

The Bank Marketing dataset contains information on customers contacted during a marketing campaign. The dataset includes features such as age, job, marital status, education, and previous marketing outcomes. The target variable indicates whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit.

## Analysis Description

The analysis involves the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Building:**
   - Building a decision tree classifier using the training data.
   - Tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluating the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
   - Visualizing the decision tree.
